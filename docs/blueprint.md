## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant reddish-orange (#E64A19) to represent the energy and dynamism of urban fashion, avoiding the cliche of using traditional Bangladeshi colors while still being eye-catching.
- Background color: Light desaturated orange (#F8D4C5) providing a clean, modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the product visuals.
- Accent color: A muted yellow (#BDB131), offering contrast for call-to-action buttons and highlighting special offers, without overwhelming the palette.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable feel; good for website and also app store descriptions
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for its artistic fashion-forward look; suitable for social media banners and website headings; use 'Alegreya' for longer-form body text such as product details or editorial-style pieces.
- Use a set of minimalist icons in the primary color, to guide users intuitively, but not distracting to the content.
- Subtle loading animations and transitions when filtering and sorting products.
